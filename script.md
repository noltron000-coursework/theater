## Plot

Frances woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After her typical breakfast of toast and an egge she left for school.
Normally Frances would have walked down Bleaker streat, but today there was construction and she decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Frances’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As she mooved slowly.
As she walked behind the zoo she could see the trees and thick floiage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Frances had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
She stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Frances would leave well enough alone, but she was worried that an animal might escape.
She stuck her head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, she called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
She took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Frances met the Unicorn King who granted him magic powers.
The end.
